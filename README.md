PROMPT
======

MATLAB toolbox for protein conformational motion simulation. To run the
demonstration script, type `calmodulin_demo`. To get help about the toolbox
functions, type `help PROMPT`.

This toolbox is the supplemental material to the paper *Modeling 
conformational change by redox-switch modulation of human succinic
semialdehyde dehydrogenase* by Gaik Tamazian, Jeong Ho Chang, Sergey
Knyazev, Eugene Stepanov, Kyung-Jin Kim and Yuri Porozov (submitted).
 
Toolbox requirements:

- MATLAB (R2014b or higher version recommended),
- Bioinformatics Toolbox,
- Optimization Toolbox,
- Statistical Toolbox.

The toolbox is also available at [MATLAB Central File Exchange](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/49054-prompt).
